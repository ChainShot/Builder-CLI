# Builder CLI

The easiest way to build learning content on ChainShot.

## Quick Start

First install the CLI globally:

```
npm i chainshot-builder -g
```

Then, you can create your first [Content Repository](https://chainshotbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content.html):

```
mkdir myContentRepository
cd myContentRepository
chainshot-builder init
```

This will spin up your IDE and you begin making content immediately! For further information,
check out the [documentation](https://chainshotbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building_new_content.html#start-editing)!
